ffmpeg_video_cutter

A simple script to make cutting a video short with ffmpeg. I hate always having to read the --help of ffmpeg to figure out what arguments I have to use. 

This just makes it easier. It will keep the original codecs and wont re-encode the video.

This is still a work in progress.
